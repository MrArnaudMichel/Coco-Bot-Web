CocoBot is a **bot** that can be used to **make videos** for Youtube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. It can also be used to make videos for other platforms, but it is optimized for these three. The bot is written in Python and uses the moviepy library to edit videos. It can be used to download a video from Youtube, add the transcript to the video, add a watermark, and other features.

## Multiple Platforms

CocoBot is a cross-platform bot, meaning it can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can also be used on mobile devices, but it is not optimized for mobile devices. It is recommended to use CocoBot on a computer.
